        <h3>Team and Player Entry Registration</h3>
          <p>The on-line team and player registration links are at the bottom of this page. You will no longer be prompted to provide player information at the time that you register your team. In mid-May we will inform you by e-mail how to supply this information on a different electronic form and we will collect that information</p> 
          
          <ul><li>during your team's players' registration on the Thursday night before your tournament starts or</li> <li>on the Saturday or Sunday morning on which your team's Tournament or Festival starts.</li></ul>
        </div>
         <div class="post"><h3>Player Registration Information Instructions </h3>
         <p>The instructions below apply to the production of Game Sheets, Discipline Logs and Bench Staff Sheets. A Game Sheet will serve as your team's Official Icebreaker Tournament Player Roster.</p>
         <p>The  links below will be activated  mid-May (or a week before the Girl's tournament begins) and the Point-of-Contact for all accepted teams will be notified by e-mail when the documents are available and instructed on how to fill in and provide us the needed information.</p> 
         <ol>
         <li>Please download the Game Sheet and Discipline Log file to your computer and open the PDF. Please note that you cannot complete this form inside a web browser. The file must be downloaded to your desktop or other file location and opened using Adobe Acrobat Reader. Fill in the required and requested information.&nbsp;</li>
         <li>Once all of the info has been entered and you are ready to print the  documents,<strong> press  the &quot;print&quot; button at the top of the page that you have just  filled in.</strong>&nbsp;The program will  automatically insert the inputted information into the appropriate fields of  the Game Sheet and the Team Discipline Log. The program will  automatically print 1 Roster, 6 to 12 Game Sheets and 1 Team Discipline Log.<br /> <strong>Do not press "Control-P" or any other printing or printer icon.</strong> Pushing either of those will cause you to print only the page on the screen. It is neither a Game Sheet nor a Team Discipline Log - and is not useful to you as a guest team or to us as hosting administrators.
</li>
   <li>Please download and complete one (1) copy of the Bench Staff List and submit it when you register your team. </li>      
  <li>A <strong>Travel Permit</strong> is required by all out-of-district teams. If your players' books contain a district stamp other from than the Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association (EODSA), you require a Travel Permit - even if you play in the Eastern Ontario Soccer League (EOSL). Please   <a href="mailto:icebreaker@ottawasoccer.com">email</a> us your travel permit once it is approved. </li>  
     <li><strong>Quebec teams:</strong> Please remember that you need two (2) stamps of approval on your Travel Permits. </li>  
         </ol>
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Registration dates and time:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Girls Festival and Torunament Thursday May 25, 2023 from 6 to 9 PM</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Boys Festival and Torunament Thursday June 1, 2023 from 6 to 9 PM</strong></li>
    </ul>
    </div>       
 <!--<p>Registration will be held from 6:00 pm until 9:00 pm on Thursday May xx, 2020 for the Girls' Icebreaker; and on May xx, 2020 for the Boys' Icebreaker.</p>  -->
 <p>Registration will be in the hallway outside of the  gym at Ecole Secondaire Franco-Cite (623 Smyth Road). This gym is at the back of the school and right in front of the artificial turf soccer and football field. It is best to park in the parking lot to the East of the building as the lot is larger than the West lot and it is closer to the registration hallway. </p>
 <p>Teams that will be travelling to Ottawa from outside the National Capital Region can register at the field  one hour before your team's first game.</p>

         <div class="post"><h3>U-9 to U-12 teams</h3>
         <p>At Player Registration, you will not need to have any  player cards (or books). Instead, you will need to provide <strong>one</strong> of two documents as proof of player registration with your provincial association:
         <ol>
           <li>An Official Ontario Soccer Team Roster or an Official Quebec Soccer Federation Team roster.</li>
           <li>A typed list of your team's Registered Players on your <strong>Soccer Club's letterhead signed by your club verifying that all players are registered with your provincial association.</strong> For Quebec teams only a 2023 Game-used Game Sheet that lists the names and registration numbers of your players.</li>
           </ol>
         <p>In addition, you will note that on the Icebreaker Game Sheets, 
         coaches must sign to confirm  that he or she will only allow the above-listed players to participate in any game in the Icebreaker Festival.
                 </div>
         <div class="post"><h3>U-13 and older teams</h3>
         <p>At Player Registration, you will need to have your players' cards (or books); and in addition, you will need to provide either a typed list of the names of your team's Registered Players on your soccer club's letterhead or you can provide an Official Ontario Soccer  Team Roster or an Official Quebec Soccer Federation Team Roster or an Official Team Roster properly completed and approved by your District Association. </p>
         <p>You will also need to show your team's Official OSA Team Roster (or QSF or District Association-provided or approved Official Roster) and the team roster for the usual outdoor team for each <strong>guest player</strong>. Please note that the OSA Roster <strong></strong>does not replace any player's missing card or book. You must have <strong>both</strong> the cards or books <strong>and</strong> one of the Roster documents listed above.</p>
         <p>Although we will not keep a copy of any OS or QSF-issued Official Roster, you will need to keep it on hand in case any player eligibility questions arise during the tournament.</p>
