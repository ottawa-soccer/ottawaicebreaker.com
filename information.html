 <p>A minimum of six (6) and a maximum of twelve (12) teams will be eligible to compete in each Tournament Divisional Age Grouping. </p>

<p>Festival Age Grouping Divisions will be structured  to allow each team to play four games. Divisional sizes may vary - but we need a minimum of five (5) teams to start a Festival Round-Robin. If demand warrants it, Divisions may be expanded and/or more than one Divisional Section may be established.</p> 

<p><strong>Register early in order to avoid disappointment.</strong> The maximum number of players per team varies depending upon the age grouping in which the team is playing. Please check the Rules pages on this web-site for your particular age group's team roster and playing limitation. In spite of the age grouping in which a player is playing, a player may be registered on only one team and in only one age group in either the Tournament and/or in the Festival.</p>

        <div class="post">
          <!--<h2>Dual Shoot-Out" Tournament</h2>
          <p>For the twenty-sixth year  the Icebreaker will again feature the  "Dual Shoot-Out" format, which guarantees each team a minimum of six (6) games, settles all games whose scores are tied at the end of regulation time by way of a Shoot-Out, and eliminates a team from further competition only after it has lost two (2) play-off round games. </p>
 <p>A Dual Shoot-Out is a tournament whose structure differs from that of a standard round-robin or cross-over tournament in that:</p> <ul><li>All games that have a tied score at the end of regulation time, immediately proceed to a shoot-out in order to declare a winner, and</li>
<li>A team must lose two (2) games in the play-off rounds in order to be eliminated from further competition.</li> 
</ul>        
          
 <p>This format provides all teams with a minimum of 6 fast-paced, exciting games, while allowing all teams to remain "in the hunt" for the Tournament Championship, even if that team has lost its first four games! </p>

<p>The purpose of this early-season tournament is to provide each team with an opportunity:</p>
<ul><li>to play at least six (6) short games, so as to give each team a chance to see how they "stack up" against several opponents;</li>
<li>to help to integrate or incorporate new players into their teams; and</li>
<li>to allow coaches an opportunity to experiment with new line-ups, strategies or tactics or to move players into different positions, without the pressure of having to win each game in order to advance in the Tournament.</li></ul> 

<p>This format was introduced to Ottawa in the 1997 edition of the "Icebreaker" and has been so favourably received and complimented by the vast majority of teams that have participated in the Icebreaker  that it has become an "unofficial Ottawa tradition" to start the outdoor soccer season with the Icebreaker's "Dual Shoot-Out" format . </p>--></div>

   <h2 id="divdefs">Icebreaker Division Definitions</h2>       
   <h3>U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12 Festival Teams</h3>       
   <p>Festival Teams are to select whether they wish to play in the stronger division (the Ice Pile) or in the standard division (the Snow Bank).</p>
   <!--<h3>U-13 to U-17 Tournament Teams</h3>    
    <h4>Ice Pile</h4>      
    <ul>
<li>EOSL District U-13 to U-17 Tier 1 teams</li>
<li>Quebec U-13 to U-18 "AA" Level teams,</li>
<li>EOSL  Development U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12 Tier 1 teams</li>
<li>Any team playing at the highest level in an Ontario Regional or a Multi-Jurisdictional League.</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> LSEQ (Quebec "AAA"), OPDL, Super-Y, Soccer Academy Alliance of Canada (SAAC) and US ODP teams will play in the Ice Pool but in the next older age grouping.</li> 
    </ul>
<h4>Snow Bank</h4>
<ul>
<li>EOSL District U-13 to U-17 Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams</li>
<li>Quebec U-13 to U-17 "A" Level teams</li>
<li>ERSL U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12  Development Tier 1 and 2 teams</li>
<li>Lower Level (i.e. Ontario "L6") teams playing in a Division other than the top Division in an Ontario Regional or a Multi-Jurisdictional League.</li>
<li>Club Teams playing in an Ontario District League,</li>
<li>Recreation level teams that are "carded" to play Competitively.</li></ul>-->
<div class="note"><p class="bold">Note</p>
<p>In the U-13 to U-17/18 Tournament age groups, we will divide the groups into the Ice Pile (regional or AA teams) and Snow Bank (C1, C2 and A teams) when possible. If we do not have the required number of teams to break out a group all teams will be in the same group. Each grouping will play a full Round-Robin preliminary set of games before teams are seeded for the Play-off games. This format guarantees each participating team a minimum of six (6) games and will use a Shoot-Out to determine a winner in all tied games in both the Preliminary and Play-Off rounds.</p>
