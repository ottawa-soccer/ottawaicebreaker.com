   <ul>
     <li><strong>Game Sheets</strong> - The Ice Breaker Tournaments use their own on-line fillable forms for Games Sheets and Bench Staff Sheet. These simple-to-use forms are available to you by using the "Forms" link on this site.</li>
       <li><strong>Team Bench Staff List</strong> - You will also need to fill in, print and submit one (1) copy of the on-line Team Bench Staff List.</li>
       <li><strong>Travel Permit</strong> - A Travel Permit is required by all out-of-district teams. If your players' books or cards contain a district stamp other than the "EODSA" stamp, you require a Travel Permit. This rule applies even if your team plays in the EOSL. Please  e-mail it to <a href="mailto:icebreaker@ottawasoccer.com">icebreaker@ottawasoccer.com</a>  before you arrive at registration. All teams registered in Quebec require two (2) approval stamps on their travel permit. One from their district and one from the FSQ. </li>
       <li><strong>Player Books/Cards</strong> - For U-13 to U-17/18 teams: At registration, you will need to have your player books or cards duly completed by your district for the 2024 outdoor season. Online or printed rosters that include the player's photo are also acceptable. Please note that we are  not permitted to accept as proof of a player's identity any other photo identification other than the player's currently approved book or card or roster picture. You must have a properly certified book or card for each player.</li>
       <li><strong>For U-9 to U-12 Teams:</strong> The Ice Breaker is not requiring teams to have a card or a passport for each of their players. Instead, each team will need to provide an Official Roster or Team List on the letterhead of the Club for which the players are registered and this List is to be signed by the Club's President, Registrar or Head Coach whose signature verifies that each listed player is registered with that Club for the 2024 Summer season and that each player is covered by  OS's or the QSF's Insurance Policy.</li>
       <li><strong>Rules</strong> - It is recommended that you download a copy of the Tournament Rules (Long Version) for your reference during the Ice Breaker.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Schedules and Changes</strong> - Tournament Schedules will be posted as soon as possible and each team will be notified by e-mail when they are available and when or if it has changed for your team's Pool. </p>
<ol><li>Click on your Age Division and Pool to view your schedule.</li>
<li>Since some Age Divisions and Pools may have more than one schedule on the page, please scroll all the way down the page to see all of the teams' schedules. Please note that groups of 12 or more teams have more than one schedule on one page.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
  <p>You must be registered in the correct pool based upon the grouping and definition posted on the <a href="information.html#divdefs">Information page</a> of this web-site. If, at registration, we found out that you are in the wrong pool, we will have no option but to not allow your team to participate in the tournament and no refund will be provided. This rule will be implemented so as to make the pools as equitable and as fair as is possible.</p>
</div>  
   
   <h3>Schedules</h3>
	<p>Schedules will be posted two weeks before the tournament.</p>
