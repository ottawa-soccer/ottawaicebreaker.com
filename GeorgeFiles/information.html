					<font style="background-color:#FFFF66"> <b> NOTICE: If you are planning to register a U-9, U-10, U-11 or U-12 Team - Please please please read the  note below entirely as many things which you ASOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW  have changed since 2013.  Thanks.</b> </font><br />
					<br />
				
				This year, the maximum number of U-13 and OLDER TEAMS that we have been authorized to accept into the Icebreaker has been set at 180 for each of the two week-ends of the Tournament.   
				<br /><br />In addition, we have been authorized to host a combined total of 164 Girls' teams and 144 Boys' teams in the U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12 Festivals.<br/><br/>Please register your team as soon as you can (even before your final player selections have been made) so as to try to avoid disappointment because in four of the last four years, we have had to turn down approximately 50 teams' applications for entry in one or the other of the two week-end competitions.  <br /><br /><b> PLEASE NOTE:  WE DO NOT </b> need a players' list or Team Roster when you register.  We simply need to know that your team exists and in which League and Division you will play this coming summer.  As per usual, we will close groups when they are full - even if this occurs before April 10, 2014.  Thanks.

				<b>THE 20th  ANNUAL OTTAWA INTERNATIONALS'
				"ICEBREAKER" SOCCER TOURNAMENT </b>
				<br />
			</font>
				<br />
				<b>Girls: May 24 and 25, 2014 :~: Boys: May 31 and June 1, 2014</b>
				<br />
				<br /></font></center>
			  <font color="#000033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dear Soccer Friends:</b>
				<br />
				<br />
				The Ottawa Internationals Soccer Club is once again very pleased to cordially invite your team to participate in the Twentieth Annual "Icebreaker" Soccer Tournament. 
				<br /><br />
				As usual, the Icebreaker will be split over two week-ends: with the Girls' Tournament being held on the week-end of May 24/25 and the Boys' Tournament being held the following week-end of May 31 and June 1, 2014.  Both competitions will include two competitive categories (the "Ice" Pile and the "Snow" Bank) in all of the age groupings from U-13 to U-18 (both inclusive).  In addition, we will be running Festivals for both the U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12 age groups - and they too will be split into an Ice Pile Festival and a Snow Bank Festival.  <BR /><BR /> 
				PLEASE NOTE THAT THE LONG-TERM PLAYER DEVELOPMENT MATRIX RESTRICTS A FESTIVAL TO A SINGLE DAY DURING THE WEEK-END.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE U-9s AND U-11s WILL PLAY ON MAY 24 (FOR THE GIRLS) AND MAY 31 (FOR THE BOYS); WHEREAS THE U-10s AND THE U-12s WILL PLAY ON MAY 25 (FOR THE GIRLS) AND JUNE 1 (FOR THE BOYS).<br/>
				<br/>  As has  been the case since 1997, in all of its tournament divisions (i.e. U-13 to U-18) the "Icebreaker" will again feature the exciting and action-packed "Dual Shoot-Out" format, which guarantees each team a minimum of six (6) games, settles all games whose scores are tied at the end of regulation time by way of a Shoot-Out, and eliminates a team from further competition only after it has lost two (2) play-off round games.  <br /><Br />Teams in the the Festival Divisions (i.e. U-9 to U-12) will play four (4) games on either the Saturday or the Sunday of the Icebreaker Festivals.
				<br />
				<br /><b>
				As has been the case for the two years that we have run Festivals at the Icebreaker, the purpose of this early-seson Festival is to provide all participating teams the opportunity to play four short games against four different opponents.  And, as was introduced last year, these Festivals' participants can choose between playing in the Ice Pile Division (which is for more skilled players and teams) or in the Snow Bank Division (which is for less experienced players and teams).  </b><br /><br />All of the "Icebreaker's" games will be held in the City of Ottawa, and, subject to receiving the minimum number of entries, competitions in the following age categories will be held: <br /><br />
				<b>Age Group Birth Dates </b><br />
				__________________________________________________________ <br />
				Under-9  Festival Mini Soccer - (7-a-side) Born on or after January 1, 2005<br />
				Under-10 Festival Mini Soccer - (7-a-side) Born on or after January 1, 2004<br />
				Under-11 Festival Mini Soccer - (9-a-side) Born on or after January 1, 2003<br/>
				Under-12 Festival Mini Soccer - (9-a-side) Born on or after January 1, 2002<br />
				Under-13 Born on or after January 1, 2001<br />
				Under-14 Born on or after January 1, 2000<br />
				Under-15 Born on or after January 1, 1999<br />
				Under-16 Born on or after January 1, 1998<br />
				Under-17 Born on or after January 1, 1997<br />
				Under-18 Born on or after January 1, 1996<br />
				<br />
				A minimum of six (6) and a maximum of twelve (12) teams will be eligible to compete in each Tournament Divisional Age Grouping.  <br /><br />Festival Age Grouping Divisions will be structured so as to allow each team to play four games and so Divisional sizes may vary - but we need a minimum of five (5) teams to start a Festival Round-Robin.  As has become customary for the Icebreaker, if demand warrants it, Divisions may be expanded and/or more than one Divisional Section may be established.
				<br />
				<br />
				Register early in order to avoid disappointment. The maximum number of players per team varies depending upon the age grouping in which the team is playing.  Please see the Rules link on this web-site for your particular age group's team roster limitation. In spite of the age grouping in which a player is playing, a player may be registered on only one team and in only one age group in either the Tournament and/or in the Festival. <br /><br ? />The Entry Fees are $250 for the U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12 one-day Festivals and $490 for the U-13 to U-18 age groups.
			  <br />
				<br />The U-13 –U-18 age groups of this Tournament have been approved the Ontario Soccer Association as an "ONACC” Tournament which means that only Competitive Club Teams from North America are eligible to participate. All participating teams have to registered to play in an outdoor league during the spring or summer of 2014 in order to be eligible to compete in the Icebreaker Tournament.  
				<br /><br />
				All teams must supply proof that they are registered with their District, Provincial or State soccer association. In addition, all out-of-district teams must produce a Travel Permit from their home soccer association which authorizes that team to compete in the Icebreaker and that all players are registered to participate in this Tournament's class. Validly certified player passbooks or cards will be the only proof of player registration that will be accepted. Improperly registered or unregistered players or teams will not be permitted to participate. Teams must carry and supply proof of injury and liability insurance while participating in this event.  PLEASE NOTE: Your team's FULLY-AUTHORIZED or APPROVED Travel Permit includes and proves this insurance coverage. 
				<br /><br />
				The U-9 to U-12 Festivals are currently approved by the local soccer governing body, the Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association (EODSA) as "Inter-District Festivals" which means that teams from anywhere within the Province of Ontario are eligible to apply for immediate entry.  WE HAVE ALSO APPLIED TO THE EODSA AND THE OSA FOR APPROVAL TO ALLOW TEAMS FROM OUTSIDE OF ONTARIO TO PARTICIPATE - BUT WE WILL NOT HEAR BACK FROM THE OSA ON THIS REQUEST UNTIL SOMETIME IN FEBRAUARY 2014.  <BR /><BR />QUEBEC-BASED TEAMS (AND TEAMS FROM ELSEWHERE IN CANADA) CAN STILL SUBMIT AN ENTRY FORM AND WE WILL RESERVE A SPOT FOR YOU AND INFORM YOU IF WE HAVE MANAGED TO SECURE "INTER-PROVINCIAL FESTIVAL" APPROVAL AS SOON AS WE HEAR BACK FROM THE OSA.  WE WILL NOT CHARGE ANY NON-ONTARIO TEAM THE ENTRY FEE UNTIL OR UNLESS WE ARE APPROVED AS AN INTER-PROVINCIAL FESTIVAL. <BR /><BR />ALL FESTIVAL PARTICIPANTS WILL NEED TO SUPPLY PHOTO IDENTIFICATION THAT ALSO DISPLAYS THE PLAYER'S DATE OF BIRTH.  PLEASE SEE THE FESTIVAL RULES FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING PLAYER IDENTIFICATION AND PROOF OF INSURANCE COVERAGE.

				<b><center>The TEAM ENTRY, TEAM WITHDRAWAL (without financial penalty) AND PAYMENT DEADLINE DATE is April 10, 2014</center></b>
				<br /><b>WHAT Is a "Dual Shoot-Out" Tournament?</b><br />
				
				A Dual Shoot-Out is a tournament whose structure differs from that of a standard round-robin or cross-over tournament in that:<br />
				a) ALL games that have a tied score at the end of regulation time, immediately proceed to a shoot-out in order to declare a winner, and<br />
				b) a team must lose two (2) games in the play-off rounds in order to be eliminated from further competition.
				<br /><br />
				This format provides all teams with a minimum of 6 fast-paced, exciting games, while allowing all teams to remain "in the hunt" for the Tournament Championship, even if that team has lost its first four games! 
				<br /><br />
				The purpose of this early-season tournament is to provide each team with an opportunity:<br />
				1)	to play at least six (6) short games, so as to give each team a chance to see how they "stack up" against several opponents;<BR />
				2)	to help to integrate or incorporate new players into their teams; and<br />
				3)	to allow coaches an opportunity to experiment with new line-ups, strategies or tactics or to move players into different positions, 
				    without the pressure of having to win each game in order to advance in the Tournament.
				<br /><br />
				This format was introduced to Ottawa in the 1997 edition of the "Icebreaker" and has been so favourably received and complimented by the vast majority of teams that have participated in the Icebreaker during the last seventeen years, that it has become an "unofficial Ottawa tradition" to start the outdoor soccer season with the Icebreaker's "Dual Shoot-Out" format .
