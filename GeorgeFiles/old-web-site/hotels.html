			<OL></OL>
			The success of any tournament relies heavily on the combination and co-operation of our large cadre of helpful and knowledgable volunteers as well as smoothly and efficiently functioning partnerships that we have established with our suppliers, sources and partners.<br/>
			<br/>
		    <b>Hudson Travel Group is the Exclusive and Official Travel Partner for the Icebreaker Soccer Tournaments and Festivals.</b> <br/><br/>As has been the case for a few years now - and just as it is a criterion at numerous other competitions in many sports - one of the criteria for acceptance into the Icebreaker will be that your hotel accommodations have been secured through Hudson Travel Group.<br/> <br /> Why? - you might ask - and the answer is - because Hudson Travel Group provides the on-line registration and team communication software that you and we need and use to make team tournament managing so much easier and efficient.  It's excellent software and without its undeniable speed, efficiency and user-friendliness, running a tournament as large and as complex as the Icebreaker would be virtually impossible and would also be a huge hassle for our guest teams.</br> <br /></br><br/>In addition, HTG secures blocks of rooms at various hotels within our tournament's geographic area at very attractive rates.  In addition, due to our long-standing relationship with HTG, their staff are well aware of the location of our fields and can set you up at a hotel that is closer to your game fields. So, please be sure to contact HTG early to secure your accommodations. </br> <br />
			</br> <br />
			Securing your team's hotel reservations EARLY is especially important to do if you will be attending the GIRLS' Icebreaker because - unfortunately, about twelve or thirteen years ago, the organizers of the National Capital Marathon and Race Week-end decided to switch their race week-end dates to the week-end that the Girls' Icebreaker Tournament's had and has always been held  - and because both events are popular and are growing, hotel rooms are quickly reserved for that week-end.  </br> <BR/><BR/>
			</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1">In fact, A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THE HOTEL ROOMS IN OTTAWA AND IN GATINEAU ARE NOW BOOKED FOR THE GIRLS' WEEK-END AND WE ARE NOW OFFERING VERY REASONABLY-PRICED ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE RESIDENCES AT ALGONQUIN COLLEGE.</BR><BR/><BR/>  SO, FOR THE GIRLS' WEEK-END, PLEASE DO NOT GO THROUGH HUDSON TRAVEL BUT CONTACT ALGONQUIN DIRECTLY FOR ACCOMMODATIONS.</BR><BR/><BR/>  ALGONQUIN'S RESIDENCES ARE WITHIN MINUTES OF THE ICEBREAKER'S PLAYING FIELDS.</BR><BR/><BR/>  PLEASE VISIT OUR "REGISTERED TEAMS" PAGES FOR THE DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THIS YEAR'S ROOM SHORTAGE SITUATION AND AS WELL TO FIND THE LINK TO VIEW AND/OR BOOK THESE ACCOMMODATIONS.  THANK YOU!<BR/>
			<BR/>There is NO ACCOMMODATIONS ISSUE for the Boys' Icebreaker week-end.</span></font><font color="#000033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR/>
