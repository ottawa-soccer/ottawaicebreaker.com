			  <B>A Sort of Short Note and Explanation of Field Assignments and Locations</B>
			  <br />
			  <br />
			  Due to the fact that the Icebreaker's Pools expand (in groups of four teams at a time) as demand dictates, 
			  it is impossible to assign fields before registrations for ALL Pools close.  Moreover, because of the Dual
			  Shoot-Out format that the tournament follows (which features more games than does the traditional 
			  tournament format), various groupings of teams require a specific number of fields - or to put it another 
			  way: certain venues can only accommodate Pools of a certain size.  (That is also why we sometimes split large 
			  Pools into two or more Sections that do not play against each other and most often play at different venues.) <br />
			  <br />
			  We receive many questions regarding where a certain Pool will be playing its games.  For the above reasons, 
			  we cannot assign fields early in the process.  We must wait until ALL of the Registrations for ALL of the Pools 
			  are closed because one Pool's size and field quantity requirements has a direct impact on the location of various 
			  other Pools.  In fact, sometimes one Pool's field quantity requirements end up have a "cascading" or "domino effect" 
			  upon the location of other Pools. <b>The Field Assignments will be announced when we issue the Preliminary Schedules on 
			    May 4, 2012.  The Field Assignments will be published on your schedule.</b><br />
			  <br />
			  In spite of the fact that it is impossible to indicate where a specific Pool will play its games, we are, 
			  due to the fact that <b>90% of the fields where the Icebreaker's games are played lie within a rather small section 
			    of the City of Ottawa</b>, able to provide our out-of-town friends with a general area within which the majority of the 
			  Icebreaker's venues are located, so that they will be able to book hotel and restauarants close to where they will 
			  be playing.<br />
			  <br />
			  <b>That general area lies within the following geographic "rectangle":  Montreal Road to the North; the International
			    Airport to the South; St. Laurent Boulevard to the East and the Rideau River to the West.  Even if one were to 
			    travel from one end of this rectangle to the other, it would only take between 20 and 25 minutes commuting time.</b><br />
			  <br />
			  Hudson Travel Group is the Icebreaker's Travel Accommodations Sponsor and has "block-booked" many rooms at very 
			  reasonable prices, in many hotels that lie within, or are very close to, this rectangle.  Please contact Hudson through
			  the "Hotels" link to the left of this page to take advantage of their block-booking.  Thanks.<br />
