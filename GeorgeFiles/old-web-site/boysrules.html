            <h2>TRAVEL &nbsp;PERMITS,&nbsp;  INSURANCE&nbsp; and&nbsp; PROOF&nbsp;  OF&nbsp; PLAYER /TEAM REGISTRATION</h2>
            <p>All teams must prove that they are  registered with their District / Provincial / State soccer association and must  play in an outdoor League.&nbsp; In addition,  all out-of-district teams (i.e. those teams whose players&rsquo; cards or passbooks  do not have the individual player registration approval &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; or signature  from the Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association (EODSA)) must produce a Travel  Permit from their home soccer association which authorizes that team to compete  in the Icebreaker and certifies that all players on that team are registered to  participate in this Tournament's &ldquo;class&rdquo;(which is restricted to &ldquo;North American  Competitive Club teams&rdquo; (ONACC) only).&nbsp; </p>
            <p>In accordance with the requirements of the  Ontario Soccer Association (OSA), validly certified player passports or cards  will be the only proof of player registration that will be accepted.&nbsp; Improperly-registered or unregistered players  or teams will not be permitted to participate.&nbsp;  In addition, during the team registration process (i.e. the Thursday  before the Tournament or on the Saturday morning one hour before the team&rsquo;s  first game) each Ontario-based team whose players&rsquo; proof of registration is a  card (as opposed to a booklet) will be required to present to a Tournament  Official an Official OSA-issued Team Roster that shows the names and birthdates  of all players who are members of that team and also shows the team&rsquo;s level-of-play  (such as: Premier, Elite, Regional, Division 1, &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;, &ldquo;AA&rdquo;, &ldquo;A&rdquo; etc.) during  the regular outdoor season.&nbsp; To clarify  further, please note that an Official Team Roster for the regular outdoor team  for each Guest Player, which roster lists the player&rsquo;s name and birthdate and  his or her regular outdoor team&rsquo;s level-of-play will need to be shown to, and  verified by, a Tournament Official.&nbsp; Following  verification, these Rosters will be returned, uncopied, to the teams by the  Tournament Official; but all teams are to keep these documents available should  they be required during the competition.</p>
            <p>Finally, teams must carry and supply proof  of injury and liability insurance while participating in this event.&nbsp; </p>
            <br />
            <h2>LAWS  &nbsp;OF &nbsp;THE &nbsp;GAME</h2>
            <p>All  games will be played in accordance with the Laws of the Game as published by  FIFA or the Laws for Mini-Soccer, except as modified herein:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <br />
            <h2>NUMBER  &nbsp;OF &nbsp;PLAYERS PER &nbsp;TEAM</h2>
            <p>All U-9 to U-11  teams may register, dress and play up to 14 (fourteen) players in the  Icebreaker.&nbsp; All U-12 to U-16 teams may  register, dress and play as many as 18 (eighteen) players in the  Tournament.&nbsp; <br /><br />
All teams that are  playing in the U-17 and U-18 Divisions may register up to 20 (twenty) players  but may dress and play up to 18 (eighteen) players in any particular game.&nbsp; <br /><br/>
A  player may be registered on only one team in the tournament and, in order to  comply with the Insurance Policy supplied by the Ontario Soccer Association  (OSA), the team may not use any player whose name was not included on the  competing team's Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster, and whose player card  or passbook was not verified prior to the commencement of the competing team&rsquo;s or  the player-in-question&rsquo;s first game in the Tournament.&nbsp; For purposes of clarity, a team&rsquo;s &ldquo;Official  Icebreaker Tournament Roster&rdquo; is that copy of the &ldquo;Icebreaker Game Sheet&rdquo; that  is retained by the Tournament Organizing Committee upon completion of a team&rsquo;s  player registration process.&nbsp; Changes can  be made to the team&rsquo;s Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster up to the start of  that team&rsquo;s first game.&nbsp; Players do not  have to play in the team&rsquo;s first game, to be included on the Official  Icebreaker Tournament Roster.&nbsp; All such  changes must be verified and initialled by a Tournament Official.&nbsp; <br />
  </p>
            <br />
            <h2>&ldquo;GUEST&rdquo;  &nbsp;PLAYERS</h2>
            <p>Each  competing team will be permitted to register up to six (6) guest players but no  more than three (3) of those players can be from a Club other than that of the  registering/competing team. (.&nbsp; All guest  players, unless playing in an older age category than for which he or she is  duly registered, must play within the level of play for which the player is  duly registered with his or her league or soccer association.&nbsp; For example, a player duly registered on a &ldquo;Regional  or AA&rdquo; team may not play on a &ldquo;Premier or Division 1 or A&rdquo; team playing in that  player&rsquo;s age group.&nbsp; All guest players  who are duly registered players from another Club must have a valid Temporary  Registration Permit which can be obtained from your District Soccer  Association&rsquo;s web-site.&nbsp; This document  needs to be signed by the &ldquo;loaning&rdquo; team and by the loaned player&rsquo;s District  Soccer Association.&nbsp; &ldquo;Duly registered&rdquo;  means that the player is currently registered with his or her District,  Provincial or State soccer association and has a valid player passbook or card.</p>
     <br />
                <h2>SUBSTITUTIONS</h2>
            <p>Substitutions,  with the consent of the Referee, <strong><u>may</u></strong> be made at the following times:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On  any goal kick<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a team&rsquo;s own throw-in (however, if the throwing team  chooses to make a substitution, then the other team can make a substitution as  well)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After  a goal has been scored<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At  half-time <br />

            <p>Substitutions  will be unlimited in number - with the consent of the Referee.&nbsp; Substitutions will not be permitted for a  player who has been ejected from that game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
           <br />
            <h2>GAME&nbsp; SHEETS</h2>
            <p>A  Field Marshall will ensure that each team enters its line-up of participating  players on the Tournament's Official Game Sheet and will hand it to the Referee  prior to the commencement of the game.&nbsp;  This Game Sheet is to be signed by the team's Coach or Manager prior to  the start of the game.</p>
            <p>Prior  to the commencement of a game in which any and all players who have to that  point in time received two (2) Yellow Cards in other games in this Tournament,  are scheduled to play, the Field Marshall will identify those players to the  Referee who is about to officiate that game.<br />
              The  Game Sheet will remain with the Referee from the start of the game and will be  returned to the Field Marshall at the end of the game.&nbsp; The Referee may choose to allow the Field  Marshall to hold the team Game Sheets while play is under way.</p>
            <p>The  Referee will record goals scored and scorers in both regulation time and during  any shoot-out, and indicate all cautions and ejections on the appropriate  team&rsquo;s Game Sheet. &nbsp;The Referee will also  describe, explain and sign all Cautions and Ejections on the appropriate OSA  Caution and Dismissal Forms.&nbsp; The Referee  will verify the correctness of the Game Sheets and Final Score by signing the  Game Sheets at the end of the match.&nbsp; The  Referee will also fill in, sign and submit to the Field Marshall Special  Incident Reports (SIR) as required.</p>
           <br />
            <h2>CONDUCT</h2>
            <p>All  Coaches, players, spectators and that team&rsquo;s supporters (parents, siblings  etc.) are expected to conduct themselves within the spirit and the letter of  the Laws of the Game.&nbsp; Each team&rsquo;s Coach  (as named on the Official Game Sheet/Roster) will be held responsible for the  behaviour of all spectators or supporters in their team's party.&nbsp; </p>
            <p><strong>Should  a Coach or other Team Official be ordered to leave the game by the Referee, the  Referee will fill in, sign and submit a SIR regarding this ordered departure to  the Field Marshall at the</strong> <strong>conclusion of the game.&nbsp; All  misconduct during the Tournament by players, Coaches and Team Officials will be  dealt with and disciplined during the Tournament according to the OSA&rsquo;s  discipline rules and regulations.&nbsp; The  EODSA will be notified of any discipline that has not been fully served during  the Tournament, for their further actions according to the OSA&rsquo;s discipline  rules and regulations.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>As  per the OSA&rsquo;s Tournament Hosting Regulations, all Referee Reports for Yellow  and Red cards, as well as all SIRs will be forwarded to the EODSA, irrespective  of whether or not the prescribed discipline has been served in its entirety  during the Tournament.</strong> </p>
            <p>To  the extent possible, both teams will have their &quot;benches&quot; on the same  side of the field and all Coaches, players (including those not participating  in the immediate game) and Team Officials are restricted to their respective sides  of the centre line.&nbsp; A maximum of four  (4) Team Officials (Coaches, Trainers, etc) will be permitted to be &ldquo;on the  bench&rdquo;.&nbsp; These persons will be designated  by each team on the Icebreaker Official Bench Personnel Listing.</p>
            <p>No  spectators will be allowed behind the goal line, or on the side of the field  that the teams occupy.</p>
            <p><strong>Alcoholic beverages, other  intoxicants and artificial noise-making or amplifying devices are not permitted  to be used at game sites or in the parking lots or streets at the game sites.</strong></p>
            <p>Although  most teams have been very tidy and responsible, all teams are requested and  urged to clean-up their &ldquo;bench&rdquo; site at the conclusion of each of their  games.&nbsp; Sufficient garbage and recycling  bins are available at each site for these purposes.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
           <br />
                <h2>DISCIPLINE</h2>
            <p>For  the purpose of discipline, the Referee's authority commences once he or she is  in the vicinity of the field and continues until he or she has left the  vicinity of the field.&nbsp; This time span  includes the teams' warm-up and warm-down periods and the souvenir  exchange/hand-shaking and the vicinity-exiting period.</p>
            <p>All  players, Team Officials and Coaches will be subject to the disciplinary rules  of the Ontario Soccer Association.</p>
            <p>Any  player who is shown a Red Card (whether as a result of having been shown two  Yellow Cards in a single game, or a direct showing of a Red Card) has the right  to request a hearing - but such a request MUST be made within five minutes of  the conclusion of the game during which the Red Card was shown.&nbsp; If the request for a hearing is not made or  is not made before the expiration of the above-described five minute time  period, the matter will be referred to and reviewed by the Tournament  Discipline Committee (TDC) for the purpose of determining the offender&rsquo;s  discipline as per the OSA&rsquo;s Published Rules regarding suspensions (see Appendix  #1).&nbsp; The TDC&rsquo;s review and ruling will  occur as soon as possible, but before the start of that player&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s next  game in the Icebreaker. </p>
            <p>If the  alleged offender does request a hearing, that person will be allowed five  minutes to explain his or her conduct to the TDC which will then decide as to  whether that person-in-question was or was not guilty of the offence described  in the Referee&rsquo;s Game Report (Game Sheets and OSA Discipline Report sheets) and  if a finding of guilt is rendered, that person will be disciplined as per the  OSA&rsquo;s Published Rules regarding suspensions (see Appendix #1).</p>
            <p>A  player who is shown a third or fifth or subsequent Yellow Card during this  Tournament, will have the incident that resulted in the showing of that Yellow  Card referred to, reviewed and ruled upon by the Tournament Discipline  Committee as to whether that player-in-question was or was not guilty of the  offence described in the Referee&rsquo;s Game Report and if a finding of guilt is  rendered, the player will be disciplined as per the OSA&rsquo;s Published Rules  regarding suspensions (see Appendix #1).&nbsp;  The Tournament Discipline Committee&rsquo;s review and ruling will occur as soon  as possible after the game in which the disciplinary-action-in-question  occurred but before the commencement of that player&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s next game in the  Icebreaker. </p>
            <p>All  players&rsquo;, Coaches&rsquo; and Team Officials&rsquo; misconduct and the discipline meted out  to him or to her at this Tournament will be reported back to the EODSA.&nbsp; All disciplined individuals&rsquo; suspension or  other penalty which was not fully served during the Tournament will be reported  back to that person&rsquo;s District or State soccer association.</p>
            <p>Any discipline  as stipulated by the OSA&rsquo;s Published Rules regarding suspensions for which the  entire suspension was not served during the Icebreaker will be noted in the  Tournament&rsquo;s Discipline Report to the EODSA and along with a history of the  suspended player&rsquo;s conduct during the Icebreaker, will be referred to the EODSA  which will follow the OSA&rsquo;s discipline rules and regulations.</p>
            <p>Any  player who was ejected for assault of a Referee or Referee&rsquo;s Assistant will not  be allowed to continue to play in the Icebreaker and the player&rsquo;s actions will  be reported to the EODSA.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>PROTESTS</h2>
            <p>Protests  will not be allowed on Referee judgment calls or on matters pertaining to  Discipline.</p>
            <p>However,  protests on other matters must be filed in writing to the Field Marshall within  one hour of the end of the game related to the protest (but before the start of  the team&rsquo;s next scheduled or possible game), and a cash deposit of $100.00 must  accompany the protest.&nbsp; This deposit will  be refunded only if the protest is upheld.&nbsp;  All teams that are or may be affected by the protest will be contacted  and allowed to make a representation of no longer than five minutes&rsquo; duration  to the Tournament Discipline Committee.</p>
            <p>A  decision will be made by the Tournament Discipline Committee before the commencement  of any of the affected teams&rsquo; next scheduled or possible game and the decision  will be final and binding.&nbsp; There will be  no appeals.</p>
           <br />
            <h2>TOURNAMENT  &nbsp;DISCIPLINE &nbsp;COMMITTEE</h2>
            <p>The  Tournament Discipline Committee will rule on all matters of protest or dispute  other than those matters that relate to a Referee&rsquo;s judgment call or those  matters that will be forwarded to the EODSA by the Tournament Discipline  Committee for their adjudication or forwarding to the OSA or to another soccer  association for their action.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
              The  Tournament Discipline Committee may consult or confer with any or all members  of the Tournament Organizing Committee (including Field Marshals) for their  assistance in collecting the facts regarding the issue-at-hand and/or in  interpreting any raised issue that applies to discipline.<br />

              <li>A team  that fails to appear at the scheduled field without valid reason within ten (10)  minutes after the game&rsquo;s scheduled kick-off time will be considered to be  &ldquo;late&rdquo; and their lateness or absence will result in a 2-0 score being awarded  to the opposing team.&nbsp; In such  circumstances, the winning team will be awarded three (3) game points but no (0)  bonus points will be awarded for that game.&nbsp;  In addition, any bonus points which may have been awarded for any other  game in which the forfeiting team may have played in this Tournament will be  cancelled.&nbsp; </li>
             
              <li>Should there be a valid reason for a team&rsquo;s late  arrival <strong>and</strong> should there be a  sufficient time and field availability in that day&rsquo;s schedule to play the game <strong>and</strong> should the team that otherwise  would have received a forfeit win agree to play the game, the game may be  re-scheduled by the Tournament Discipline Committee</li>
             
              <li>Should  both teams fail to appear at the scheduled field without valid reason within  ten (10) minutes after the scheduled kick-off time, neither team will be  awarded points (see below) and both teams will be recorded as having lost the  game, and the score will be recorded as 0-0.&nbsp; </li>
              
              <li>Failure to appear, without valid reason, may result in  the expulsion of the team or teams from the remainder of the Tournament.&nbsp; No refund of the team&rsquo;s entry fee, either in  total or in part, will be made. </li>
          
              <li>Should there be a valid reason for both team&rsquo;s late  arrival and should there be a sufficient time and field availability in that  day&rsquo;s schedule to play the game, the game may be re-scheduled by the Tournament  Discipline Committee.</li>
             
              <li>In the sets of circumstances (described in 1A) and 1B)  above) where a re-scheduling of the game does not occur, and when appropriate,  the Tournament Discipline Committee will have to decide, in the interest of  fairness to all competitors, whether bonus points should be re-instated or  credited and/or game results and/or goals for and against (or differential)  should be included in the tie-breaking calculations; and if consultation is  sought by the Committee on this issue, each and all affected teams will be  allowed to make a representation to the Committee of no longer than five  minutes duration.</li>
            
              <li>When a team fails to appear or is late, the Tournament  Discipline Committee will act as the sole judge as to the validity of the  team&rsquo;s reason for being late or for having failed to appear and will also be  the sole decision maker as to whether the team should be expelled from the  remainder of the Tournament.</li>

            <h3>2)&nbsp; Insufficient  Number of Players</h3>
            <ol>
              
              <li>For the U-9, U-10 and U-11 age categories, the minimum  number of players who are required to commence or to continue a game is five  (5).&nbsp; For all other age groups, the  minimum number of players who are required in order to commence or to continue  a game is seven (7).&nbsp; </li>
              
              <ol type="A">
              <li> Should  a team become unable to commence or to continue a game due to the fact that a  sufficiently great number of its players has received Red or accumulated Yellow  Cards, that team will be declared to have lost the game <strong>by violative misconduct</strong> (even if that team was leading at the time  of the showing of the latest disciplinary card) and will be suspended from  further participation in the Tournament.&nbsp;  If the game had not started, a score of 2-0 will be awarded to the  winning team.&nbsp; However, should the game  have started, the winning score will either be 2-0 or the existing score at the  time when the game was halted (whichever score is most favourable to the team  that is being awarded the win).&nbsp; All  future scheduled opponents of the expelled team, will also be awarded 2-0 wins.</li>
               
              <li> Should  a team become unable to commence or to continue a game because it cannot  &ldquo;field&rdquo; the minimum required number of players due to injuries or illness, that  team will be declared to have lost the current game <strong>by mishap default</strong>.&nbsp; If the  game had not started, a score of 2-0 will be awarded to the winning team.&nbsp; However, should the game have started, the  winning score will either be 2-0 or the existing score at the time when the  game was halted (whichever score is most favourable to the team that is being  awarded the win), but the losing team will be allowed to continue in the  Tournament (as long as this is not the losing team&rsquo;s second loss after the &ldquo;Ice  Jam&rdquo; round of games) if it can &ldquo;field&rdquo; the minimum required number of players  in its future scheduled or assigned games. </li>
               
              <li> Should  a team become unable to commence or to continue a game because it cannot  &ldquo;field&rdquo; the minimum required number of players due to non-injury-related  absences (excluding the showing of Yellow and/or Red cards), that team will be  declared to have lost the current game <strong>by  avoidable default</strong>.&nbsp; If the game had  not started, a score of 2-0 will be awarded to the winning team.&nbsp; However, should the game have started, the  winning score will either be 2-0 or the existing score at the time when the  game was halted (whichever score is most favourable to the team that is being  awarded the win); and the losing team will be expelled from the  Tournament.&nbsp; All future scheduled  opponents of the expelled team, will also be awarded 2-0 wins.</li>
              
              <li> Should  a team refuse to field a sufficient number of players to start or to continue a  game, or should it withdraw its players from the field (even for a temporary  period), that team will be declared to have lost the current game <strong>by</strong> <strong>defiant  misconduct</strong> (even if the withdrawing or refusing team was leading at the  time of the refusal or withdrawal).&nbsp; If  the game had not started, a score of 2-0 will be awarded to the winning  team.&nbsp; However, should the game have  started, the winning score will either be 2-0 or the existing score at the time  when the game was halted (whichever score is most favourable to the team that  is being awarded the win).&nbsp; The team that  refused to field a sufficient number of players or that withdrew its players  from the field will be expelled from further play in the Tournament.&nbsp; All future scheduled opponents of the  expelled team, will also be awarded 2-0 wins.&nbsp; </li>
             
              <li> Should  a team&rsquo;s Bench Staff and/or supporters become so unruly or abusive of the  Referee or Referee&rsquo;s Assistants or any Tournament Official, before, during or  after a game (even if the Referee allowed the game to continue to its  conclusion and/or even if the allegedly offending team was leading or had won  the game), the Tournament Discipline Committee may declare that the allegedly  offending to have lost the game <strong>by sideline  misbehaviour.&nbsp; </strong>If the game had not  started, a score of 2-0 will be awarded to the opposing team.&nbsp; However, should the game have started, the  winning score will either be 2-0 or the existing score at the time when the  game was halted (whichever score is most favourable to the team that is being  awarded the win).&nbsp; The team that was  declared to have lost by sideline misbehaviour will be expelled from further  play in the Tournament.&nbsp; All future  scheduled opponents of the expelled team, will also be awarded 2-0 wins.</li>
              </ol>
               
             <br /> - Should one or more expulsion under item A), C), D) or  E) occur before, during or after a &ldquo;Medal Game&rdquo;, the offending team will  forfeit any and all awards, plaques and/or medals.&nbsp; Should a team be unable to start or to  continue to play in a Medal Game due to circumstances that are described in  item B), that team will be declared to have lost the game but will still  receive whatever awards, plaques and/or medals that they would have received  had they played or completed the game-in-question. 
              
             <br /> <br />- In the event that any team is expelled from the  Tournament under this section&rsquo;s item A), C), D) or E), or withdraws or is  declared incapable of continuing to compete in the tournament under item B), or  withdraws from the Tournament for any other reason, the Tournament Organizing  Committee will consult with the Tournament Discipline Committee and may do one,  some, all or none of the following:</li>
               
             <ol type="a"> <li>Re-align the &ldquo;Pools&rdquo; within the age  group(s) affected; and/or</li>

              <li>Invoke any other decision to maintain  the fairness and competitiveness of  the competition. </li>
             </ol>
              - In addition, the Referee will complete, sign and submit a Special  Incident Report (SIR) to the Field Marshall and the conduct of the offending  team will be reported to the EODSA for their review and supplementary  disciplinary action.
            </ol>
              
             
             
             <h2>DURATION/NUMBER &nbsp;OF &nbsp;GAMES &nbsp;and&nbsp; BALL  &nbsp;SIZE</h2>
              
              All &quot;Ice Jam&quot; (Round-robin) games will be  thirty (30) minutes long, and although there will be no half-time break, teams  will change ends when the Referee signals for half-time.
              
              <br /><br />All &quot;Ice Floe&quot; (Play-off) games and the  &quot;Melt Down&quot; (Championship) game in each Division will consist of  twenty (20) minute halves, and there will be a five (5) minute break at  half-time.<br /><br />
              All games in the U-9, U-10, U-11 and U-12 Divisions will be played using the size #4 FIFA-approved ball that was supplied to each team by the Icebreaker Tournament.&nbsp; All other age  groups will use the size #5 FIFA-approved ball that was provided to each team by the Icebreaker Tournament.  In all Divisions, both teams will provide their current-year Icebreaker ball to the Referee for use during the game between the opposing teams.
             <br /><br />Each team is guaranteed a total of six (6) games &ndash;  four (4) of which will be played on the Saturday of the Tournament and two (2)  on the Sunday. <br /><br />
             
             <br />
             <h2>COMPETITION STRUCTURE</h2>
           <u><strong>Age Groups</strong></u>
            <ul>
              <li>There is a separate competition  for each single-year Age Group for both Girls&rsquo; and Boys&rsquo; teams. </li>
               <li>Due to an insufficient  number of entrants in any particular age group, we may combine two birth years  into a single Age Group or we may combine the Ice Pile and Snow Bank Divisions  into&nbsp; single Division.&nbsp; This latter situation frequently happens in  the U-16/U-17 and the U-17/U-18 Age Groups. </li>
            </ul>
               
               <strong><u>Ice Piles and Snow Banks</u></strong> 
              <ul><li>
              Each Age Group - other than  U-9 - normally has two levels-of-play.&nbsp; For  various reasons, sometimes, these levels-of-play are combined in a single  grouping.</li>
              <li>All U-9 teams play in the  same grouping.</li>
           
              <li>Below is a breakdown of  teams from various levels of competition that are eligible to play the Ice Pile  or Snow Bank groups in the Icebreaker: </li>
              
             <br /> <ol type="a">
              
              <strong><u>Ice&nbsp; Pile</u></strong> 
             
            <br /> ERSL U-13 to U-18 Regional  (L3) teams, Quebec &ldquo;AA&rdquo; Level teams,<br />
              EODSA League U-10, U-11 and  U-12 Division 1 teams and<br />
              Any team playing at the  HIGHEST LEVEL within an Ontario Regional or a Multi-Jurisdictional League.<br />
              <em>Note:</em> OYSL, LSEQ (Quebec &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), ODP teams will play in the Ice Pool but must  play in the next highest age grouping. 
            
            
             <br /><br /><strong><u>Snow Bank</u></strong> 
         
            <p>ERSL U-13 to U-18 Premier and  EODSA Division 1 teams, Quebec &ldquo;A&rdquo; Level teams,<br />
              EODSA League U-10, U-11 and U-12 Division 2 teams,<br />
              Lower level teams within an Ontario Regional or a Multi-Jurisdictional League, <br />
              Club Teams playing in an Ontario District League and<br />
              Recreation level teams that are &ldquo;carded&rdquo; to play Competitively.<br />
              Note: ERSL U-13 to U-18  Regional (L3) teams, Quebec &ldquo;AA&rdquo; Level teams playing up in an older age group  can participate in the Snow Bank for that older age group.</p>
           
               Ontario &ldquo;L4&rdquo; or a Quebec  &ldquo;AA&rdquo; Snow Bank entrants can play in either the Snow Bank or in the Ice Pile.<br /><br />
              Ontario &ldquo;L5&rdquo; and Quebec &ldquo;A&rdquo; teams  should remain in the Snow Bank.</li>
              <br /><br />An Ontario &ldquo;L3&rdquo; or a Quebec  &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; team MUST play in the Ice Pile and MUST play up a year and can only play  in a Snow Bank is it plays up by two years.
              <br /><br />On rare occasions, an Age  Group will be comprised of a co-mingling of Ice Pile and Snow Bank teams.&nbsp; This most often occurs in the U-16/U-17 and the  U-17/U-18 Age Groups.  
              </ol>
              
              
              <strong><u>Sections</u></strong> 
             <br /><br />Some Age Groups attract more  than 12 or 16 teams which necessitates the establishment of a second or sometimes,  a third, &ldquo;Section&rdquo; within that Age Group and Snow Bank or Ice Pile.<br /><br />
             Once a second or subsequent  Section is required, all sections are named as follows: Nunavut Section, Yukon  Section, Ungava Section and Beaufort Section.</li>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <strong><u>Divisions</u></strong><br /><br />
            Divisions occur ONLY in Age  Groups or Sections with 12 teams.&nbsp; The  Division names are as follows:&nbsp; Muskeg  Division, Tundra Division, Skree Division and Permafrost Division.
            
             <br /><br /><br />
             <strong><u>Pools</u></strong>
             <br /><br />Each Ice Pile or Snow Bank  is divided into Pools of teams.&nbsp; Six-team  and Eight-team Age Groups have two Pools which are named as follows: Penguin  Pool and Narwahl Pool.<br />
             <br />Twelve-team and sixteen-team  Age Groups have both Section names (as above) and four Pools which are named as  follows: Yukon Section - Penguin Pool and Narwhal Pool; Nunavut Section - Polar  Bear Pool and Muskox Pool.<br /><br />
             During the &ldquo;Ice Jam&rdquo; portion  of the Icebreaker, competitors in Pools of four-teams will play an &ldquo;internal&rdquo;  round-robin against each of the other member teams in its Pool; whereas teams  in three-team Pools will play a &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; round-robin against each of the  teams in the other Pool.<br /><br />
             In the &ldquo;Ice Floe&rdquo; portion of  the Tournament:</li>
            <br /><br />Teams in Age Groups with 12  teams will play against teams from the other Pools in the Age Group.<br /><br />
            Teams in Age Groups with 16  teams may play against teams from the other Section in the Age Group.</li>
              <br /><br />Teams in Age Groups with 20,  24 or more teams will not play against teams from the other Section(s) in the  Age Group.
              <br /><br /><br />
              
             <strong><u>Odd-Sized Configurations</u></strong>
             <br /><br />From time to time, due to  late withdrawals, or to a required combination of Age Groups and/or Pile or  Banks, or to a registration error, we end up with odd-sized groupings.&nbsp; <br /><br />
             A separate schedule is  drafted for these combinations of teams and although the shoot-out aspect of  the Icebreaker will be maintained, the Dual-loss feature may be impossible to  maintain.
             
              
              
              
              
              
              </ol></ol></ol>
              
              <h2>POINTS&nbsp; SYSTEM</h2>
              <strong><em>&quot;Ice Jam&quot; (Round-Robin) Games</em></strong>
              The number of teams competing in any particular Age  and Calibre-of-play Division (called the &ldquo;Ice Pile&rdquo; or &ldquo;Snow Bank&rdquo;) may range  from 6 to 16.&nbsp; These teams will be  grouped into three-team or four-team &ldquo;Pools&rdquo;, so as to allow for each team to  play 4 (four) games on the first day of the Tournament.&nbsp; The first three games will be Ice Jam games,  while the fourth will be the teams&rsquo; first game of the Ice Floe Play-off  round.&nbsp; Some age groups will play  Round-Robins, whereas others will have cross-over games.&nbsp;<br /><br />
               (In Divisions of 12 teams, there will be two six-team  Sections (the &ldquo;Yukon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nunavut&rdquo; Sections) and each section will be  comprised of two three-team Pools.&nbsp; Due  to the existence of cross-overs, a team may switch back and forth between these  Sections and may in fact end up in the other Section at the conclusion of the  tournament.)<br /><br />
               Three (3) game points will be awarded in each Ice Jam  game.&nbsp; Three (3) game points will be  awarded for a win in regulation time, two (2) game points for a shoot-out win,  one (1) game point for a shoot-out loss and zero (0) game points for a loss in  regulation time.&nbsp; <br /><br />
               There will be no ties.&nbsp;  All games that are tied at the end of regulation time, will immediately  proceed to a <strong>three-player shoot-out</strong> (penalty kicks) by using players who  were on the field at the end of regulation time.&nbsp; If the teams are still tied after each team  has taken three penalty kicks, FIFA sudden-death penalty kicks will be taken  until a winner is declared.&nbsp; 
               <br /><br />This feature is where the Tournament derives the  &quot;Shoot-Out&quot; portion of its name
               
               <br /><br />In addition, <strong>the team winning a game in regulation  time will be awarded bonus points based on the game's goal differential, up to  a maximum of three (3) points per game.</strong>&nbsp;  These points will only be used in an effort to break ties in game point  accumulations in order to &quot;seed&quot; teams for the &quot;Ice Floe&quot;  Play-Off rounds.&nbsp; The losing team does  not lose bonus points.&nbsp; Bonus points are  not awarded for shoot-out wins.
               <br /><br />
               Teams will be &quot;seeded&quot; from #1 to #4 in each  Pool within an eight-team category (#1 to #3 in a six-team category).&nbsp; This ranking is based upon the <strong>total</strong> <strong>number  of game points (not bonus points) </strong>that are earned by the team during the  &quot;Ice Jam&quot; round.&nbsp; Teams with  identical game point accumulations will be ranked based upon the following  criteria: 
               
            <ol>
              <li>Winner of the game between the tied teams (including a  shoot-out win),</li>
              <li>Most wins in regulation time,</li>
              <li>Most bonus points,</li>
              <li>Most goals for in regulation time,</li>
              <li>Fewest goals against in regulation  time,</li>
              <li>Fewest losses including shoot-out  losses,</li>
              <li>Most shut-outs for in regulation time,</li>
              <li>Fewest shut-outs against in regulation  time, </li>
              <li>Fewest goals against in shoot-outs,</li>
               
                          <li>Most goals for in shoot-outs,</li>
                          <li>A single coin-toss </li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A Tournament Official will arbitrarily  decide which team will predict the toss &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outcome.)</p>
           
          
            A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all  four-team Pools, when two teams are tied, that tie will be broken by way of the  first tie-breaking criterion as a shoot-out win is included under this  criterion. <br /><br />
               B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Pools  of three teams, the tie-breaking criteria will always start with criterion #2  as these Pools play only cross-over games and do not play each other in the Ice  Jam portion of the Icebreaker.<br /><br />
               Should more than two teams be tied, this list will be  used in sequence (starting at criterion #1) for each pair of tied teams and  followed in order until the tie is broken and then the efforts at breaking the  tie between the other tied teams will re-commence with criterion #1 again,  until all ties are broken and the teams are assigned a ranking or placing.<br /><br /><br />
               <strong><em>&quot;Ice Floe&quot; (Play-Off) Games</em></strong> 
            <br />Although, the pairings for the first round of  &quot;Ice Floe&quot; games will vary depending upon the number of teams that  are participating in a particular age category, in general, the each team&rsquo;s  first game will be against a new opponent either from their own Pool or from  another Pool in that Division or age category. <br /><br />
            In a Division with eight (8) teams, the First Place  team in Pool A will play the Fourth Place team in Pool B.&nbsp; The Second Place team in Pool A will compete  against the Third Place team in Pool B, and so on.&nbsp; <br /><br />
            In a Division with six (6) teams, the First Place Team  in Pool A will play the Third Place team in Pool A.&nbsp; The same applies to Pool B; whereas the  Second Place teams in each Pool will play each other.<br /><br />Again, there will be no ties.&nbsp; All games in the &quot;Ice Floe&quot; rounds  that are tied at the end of regulation time will immediately proceed to a <strong>five-player  shoot-out</strong> (penalty kicks).&nbsp; If the  teams are still tied after each team has taken five penalty kicks, FIFA  sudden-death penalty kicks will be taken until a winner is declared.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <strong><em>Icebreaker &ldquo;Melt Down&rdquo; Game</em></strong> <br />
            <strong>The Divisional Championship game</strong>, which <strong>is called the <em>&quot;Melt  Down&quot;</em></strong>will also be played on Sunday.&nbsp; Again, all ties at the end of regulation time  will be settled via a <strong>five-player shoot-out</strong>.&nbsp; If the teams are still tied after each team  has taken five penalty kicks, FIFA sudden-death penalty kicks will be taken  until a winner is declared.&nbsp; <br />
            
            <h2>ELIMINATION</h2>

              <ul>

              <li>The Home Team will also be responsible for providing a  Game Ball that is deemed of sufficient quality by the Referee.&nbsp; Should the Home Team not be able to satisfy  the Referee&rsquo;s quality standard for the Game Ball, the &ldquo;Visiting&rdquo; Team will be  asked to provide such a ball.&nbsp; Should  neither team be able to provide a ball of sufficient quality, the Referee will  choose the best ball available from any source at that time.</li>

             <h2>UNFAVOURABLE WEATHER  &amp;  UNUSABLE  FIELD CONDITIONS</h2>
              
            <ul><li>Under normal conditions, every game is to be played at  its scheduled time and location.&nbsp;  However, if inclement weather conditions or unsafe or unusable field  conditions occur, the location and kick-off time may be changed. However,  unless previously advised otherwise by the Tournament Chairman, or his  delegate, all scheduled teams must appear at the scheduled location at the  stated start time regardless of these conditions.</li>
            
              <li>The Referee assigned to officiate any particular game,  has the authority to delay, not to start, to stop or to suspend that game due  to weather and/or field conditions.&nbsp;  Field Convenors have the authority to re-locate or re-schedule it due to  weather conditions and/or field conditions and/or availability.&nbsp; </li>
            
              <li><strong>NO GAME WILL BE PLAYED DURING  AN ELECTRICAL STORM.</strong>&nbsp; When an electrical storm occurs  during a game, play will be immediately suspended (delayed) until the storm  passes.&nbsp; If in such weather conditions,  the Referee does not suspend or stop the game, the Field Marshal or any other  tournament Official may order the game to be suspended or may halt the game by  seizing the game ball.&nbsp; Under no  circumstances may teams withdraw from the playing field or venue area, (the  parking lots etc.) until the Referee or his delegate has advised them that they  may do so.&nbsp; </li>
      
               <ol type="A"><li>If a  game is abandoned (i.e. cannot be completed due to insufficient daylight time  or unplayable field conditions and cannot be re-located or re-scheduled) the  Tournament Discipline Committee will rule on that game&rsquo;s status, <strong>but every reasonable attempt must be made  to complete all games in their entirety.</strong>&nbsp;  When 75% or more of a game has been played, AND the Referee determines  that play cannot safely continue due to weather and/or field and/or light  conditions, and cannot be re-located or re-scheduled, that game will be  abandoned (ended) and will be considered to have been completed and the score  at that time will become the final regulation time score. </li>
              <li><strong>If a game is suspended and then re-started,  the game will not be deemed to have been completed simply because 75% of the  game time has been played.</strong>&nbsp; Instead,  play must continue as long as is safely possible - regardless of any single or  multiple weather-caused or field-conditions-caused game suspensions, unless  that game is declared by the Referee to be &ldquo;unfinishable&rdquo; due to inclement  weather or light-loss or unsafe field conditions. In the event that a game is  suspended due to unsafe field conditions, the remainder of the game may be  played later that same day or the following morning (if appropriate) on another  field.&nbsp; The Tournament President, in  consultation with the convenor of the affected age group and any with other  persons that they may choose, will make the final decision as to the possible  re-scheduling and re-location of the remainder of the suspended game. </li>
             
              <li>If when  a game is suspended it is less than 75% completed and it is later decided that  it cannot be re-started, re-scheduled or re-located (and therefore is declared  as &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;), the game will be declared as complete and the score existing at  the time of the game&rsquo;s suspension will become the final regulation time  score.&nbsp; </li>
             
              <li>If the situations described in A), B) and C) above,  occur, and should the final regulation time score be tied, all efforts will be  made to conduct the shoot-out portion of the competition.&nbsp; If necessary, the shoot-out will be  re-scheduled and/or re-located.&nbsp; If a  shoot-out is impossible to hold, a single coin toss will be used to determine  the winner of the game.&nbsp; A Tournament  Official will arbitrarily decide which team predicts the toss outcome.</li></ol>
             
              <li>In the event that inclement weather and/or diminished light  and/or poor and/or dangerous field conditions make it impossible or unwise (for  player harm or field damage reasons) to continue playing the scheduled games and  all other efforts (such as switching fields, shortening game lengths, etc.)  will not enable the competition to continue in any Section or Division within  the tournament (or within the tournament in its entirety), all efforts will be  made to complete the Ice Jam games of the competition.&nbsp; After that portion of the tournament is  completed and if the bad weather/light/field conditions persist, all planned games  will then employ the FIFA Shoot-Out procedures in order to declare a game&rsquo;s  winner.&nbsp; </li>
              
              <li>If conditions prevent even the Ice Jam portion from  being completed, then shoot-outs will be employed for all games remaining to be  played in that Section or Division as well.&nbsp; </li>
              
              <li>In those Sections which do employ a complete  round-robin competition between all teams (such as in a five-team or seven-team  grouping) in the Ice Jam portion of the tournament, once the round-robin  portion has been completed (and the competition cannot proceed for the  above-mentioned reasons), the Gold and Silver Medalists will be determined from  the results of that Section&rsquo;s round-robin game results.</li>
             </ul>

            <ul><li>All teams that have had their player cards or  passbooks, their Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster and Game Sheets verified  by Tournament Officials on Team Registration Verification Night are required to  check-in with the Field Marshall, or his or her delegate at the scheduled  playing field, thirty (30) minutes before the kick-off of the team&rsquo;s first  game.&nbsp; This check-in is simply to verify  the team&rsquo;s arrival and to ascertain that they are at the correct field as some  venues have several fields.</li>

              <li>Teams that did not have their player cards or  passbooks, their Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster and Game Sheets verified  and stamped by Tournament Officials on Team Registration Verification Night, are  required to check-in with the Field Marshall, or his or her delegate, at their  team&rsquo;s first game&rsquo;s scheduled playing field, sixty (60) minutes before the  kick-off of the team&rsquo;s first game in order to have each player&rsquo;s passbook or  card verified as being current and for the correct age group.&nbsp; At that time, these teams are also to present  the Field Marshall with the Travel Permission Form and Proof of Insurance  Coverage documentation (if these documents are required and had not previously  been sent in by mail, fax or e-mail to the Tournament Organizing  Committee).&nbsp; </li>
