            <b>AGE AND ELIGIBILITY</b><br>
            <br>
        This Tournament is open to teams composed of players all of whose birth dates fall within the age group calendar birth years listed below.  Boys’ teams will be permitted the use of female players but all of the players on Girls’ teams must be female.  Teams must provide a Player Passport or player card for each player, which book or card certifies that the player’s age falls within the age group for which his or her applying team has submitted an entry form.  In addition, each player must be authorized his or her District, Provincial or State soccer association to play at or above the competitive level for which the player’s team has applied for entry.  Under no circumstances will players who are older than the age group level in which the team has applied for entry, or players who are registered with their governing soccer association to play at a higher level of competition than for which the team has applied for entry, be allowed to play in that age group or competitive level.  In other words, “playing down” age-wise or calibre-wise (within the same birth year) will not be permitted.  Teams violating this rule will be expelled from further Tournament play, their entry fee will be forfeited and this usage of all age-ineligible players and the players’ identity will be reported to the Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association (EODSA), which may forward the relevant information to the players’ and team’s home soccer association to exercise their authority to enforce additional disciplinary sanctions against the offending team and players.

            <br>
            Teams in the U-10 and U-11 age categories may register, dress and play as many as 16 (sixteen) players in the Tournament.  All older teams can register, dress and play a maximum of 18 (eighteen) players in the Tournament.  A player may be registered on only one team and, in order to comply with the Insurance Policy supplied by the Ontario Soccer Association (OSA), the team may not use any player whose name was not included on the competing team's Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster, and whose player card or passbook was not verified prior to the commencement of the competing team’s first game in the Tournament.  For purposes of clarity, a team’s “Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster” is that copy of the “Icebreaker Game Sheet” that is retained by the Tournament Organizing Committee upon completion of a team’s player registration process.  Changes can be made to the team’s Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster up to the start of that team’s first game.  All such changes must be verified and initialled by a Tournament Official.

All guest players, unless playing in an older age category than for which he or she is duly registered, must play within the level of play for which the player is duly registered with his or her league or soccer association.  For example, a player duly registered on a Regional team may not play on a Premier or Division 1 team playing in that player’s age group.  All guest players who are duly registered players from another Club must have a valid Temporary Registration Permit.  “Duly registered” means that the player is currently registered with his or her District, Provincial or State soccer association and has a valid player passbook or card.<br>

            <br>
            <b>Failure to Show</b> <br>
            <br>
            Failure of a team to appear at the scheduled location without valid 
            reason within ten minutes after the scheduled kick-off time will result 
            in a 1-0 score being awarded to the opposing team. In such circumstances, 
            no bonus points will be awarded for that game or for any other game 
            in which the forfeiting team played in this Tournament. <br>
            <br>
            Should both teams fail to appear at the scheduled location without 
            valid reason within ten minutes after the scheduled kick-off time, 
            neither team will be awarded points (see below) and both teams will 
            be recorded as having lost the game, and the score will be recorded 
            as 0-0. <br>
            <br>
            Failure to appear, without valid reason, may result in the expulsion 
            of the team(s) from the remainder of the Tournament and for the forfeiture 
            of the team’s or teams’ entry fee(s). However, all game results up 
            to the forfeited game will stand, but no bonus points will be awarded 
            for any game in which the forfeiting team(s) played; and goals for 
            and against for all opponents of the defaulting team(s) will not be 
            included in any tie-breaking calculations.<br>
            <br>
            In these instances, the Tournament Discipline Committee will be the 
            sole judge as to whether the team or teams should be expelled from 
            the remainder of the Tournament. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Insufficient Number of Players</b> <br>
            <br>
            For the U-10 and U-11 age categories, the minimum number of players 
            who are required to commence or continue a game is five (5). For all 
            other age groups, the minimum number of players who are required in 
            order to commence or to continue a game is seven (7). Should a team 
            become unable to commence or to continue a game due to the fact that 
            a sufficient number of its players has received Red or Yellow Cards, 
            that team will be declared the loser of the current game and will 
            be suspended from further participation in the Tournament. The winning 
            team will be awarded the win by a score of 2-0 or by the existing 
            score at the time of suspension of the game if that is more favourable 
            to the winning team. <br>
            <br>
            Should a team be unable to commence or to continue a game because 
            it cannot "field" the minimum required number of players due to injuries 
            or other absences, that team will be declared to have lost the current 
            game by default (if the game has not started) or by a score of 2-0 
            or by the existing score at the time when the game was halted (whichever 
            score is most favourable to the team that is being awarded the win), 
            but the losing team will be allowed to continue in the Tournament 
            (as long as this is not the losing team’s second loss after the "Ice 
            Jam" round of games) if it can "field" the minimum required number 
            of players in its future scheduled or assigned games. <br>
            <br>
            In these two sets of circumstances described in 2) above, and when 
            appropriate, the Tournament Discipline Committee will have to decide, 
            in the interest of fairness to all competitors, whether bonus points, 
            game results and goals should be included in tie-breaking calculations; 
            and if consultation is sought by the Committee on this issue, all 
            affected teams will be allowed to make a representation to the Committee 
            of no longer than five minutes duration. <br>
            <br>
            In the even that one or more teams is expelled from, or withdraws 
            (for whatever reason) from the Tournament, the Tournament Organizing 
            Committee will consult with the Tournament Discipline Committee and 
            may do any or all of the following:<br>
            <br>
            (a) re-align the "pools" within the age group(s) affected; and/or 
            <br>
            <br>
            (b) revise the schedule; <br>

            <b>DURATION/NUMBER OF GAMES AND BALL SIZE</b><br>
            <br>
            All "Ice Jam" (Round-robin) games will be thirty (30) minutes long, 
            and although there will be no half-time break, teams will change ends 
            when the Referee signals for half-time. <br>
            <br>
            All "Ice Floe" (Play-off) games and the "Melt Down" (Championship) 
            game in each Division will consist of twenty (20) minute halves, and 
            there will be a five (5) minute break at half-time.<br>
            <br>
            For all age groups up to and including U-12, all games will be played 
            using a Size #4 FIFA-approved ball that will be provided by the Home 
            Team for that game. All other age groups will use a size #5 FIFA-approved 
            ball that will be provided by the Home Team for that game. <br>
            <br>
            Each team is guaranteed a total of 6 (six) games - 4 (four) of which 
            will be played on the Saturday of the Tournament and 2 (two) on the 
            Sunday. <br>
            <br>

            <b>POINTS SYSTEM</b> <br>
            <br>
            <b>"Ice Jam" (Round-Robin) Games</b> <br>
            <br>
            The number of teams competing in any particular age group may range 
            from 5 to 16. These teams will be grouped so as to allow for each 
            team to play 4 (four) games on the first day of the Tournament. In 
            most instances, the first three games will be Ice Jam games, while 
            the fourth will be the teams’ first game of the Ice Floe Play-off 
            round. In other cases, all four games will be Ice Jam games. Some 
            age groups will play complete Round-Robins, whereas others may have 
            cross-over games. Shoot-outs will take place in the event of a regulation 
            time tie, but the dual loss requirement for elimination will not be 
            followed in categories with five (5) or seven (7) teams. In addition, 
            the game lengths will be identical for all games in categories with 
            five (5) or seven (7) teams. In Divisions of five (5) teams, these 
            games will consist of two (2) twenty-five (25) minute halves with 
            a five (5) minute rest period at half time; and in Divisions of seven 
            teams (7), the halves will last 17.5 minutes with a 5 minute rest 
            period at half time. <br>
            <br>
            There are three (3) game points to be awarded in each game. Three 
            (3) game points will be awarded for a win in regulation time, two 
            (2) game points for a shoot-out win, one (1) game point for a shoot-out 
            loss and zero (0) game points for a loss in regulation time. <br>
            <br>
            There will be no ties. All games that are tied at the end of regulation 
            time, will immediately proceed to a three-player shoot-out (penalty 
            kicks) by using players who were on the field at the end of regulation 
            time. If the teams are still tied after each team has taken three 
            penalty kicks, FIFA sudden-death penalty kicks will be taken until 
            a winner is declared. <br>
            <br>
            In addition, the team winning a game in regulation time will be awarded 
            bonus points based on the game's goal differential, up to a maximum 
            of three (3) points per game. These points will only be used in an 
            effort to break ties in game point accumulations in order to "seed" 
            teams for the "Ice Floe" Play-Off rounds. The losing team does not 
            lose bonus points. Bonus points are not awarded for shoot-out wins.<br>
            <br>
            Teams will be "seeded" from #1 to #4 in each pool within an eight-team 
            category. This ranking is based upon the total number of game points 
            that are earned by the team during the "Ice Jam" round. Teams with 
            identical game point accumulations will be ranked based upon the following 
            criteria:<br>
            <br>
            1) winner of the game between the tied teams, <br>
            <br>
            2) most wins in regulation time, <br>
            <br>
            3) most bonus points, <br>
            <br>
            4) most goals for in regulation time, <br>
            <br>
            5) fewest goals against in regulation time, <br>
            <br>
            6) fewest losses including shoot-out losses, <br>
            <br>
            7) most shut-outs for in regulation time,<br>
            <br>
            8) fewest shut-outs against in regulation time, fewest goals against 
            in shoot-outs, most goals for in shoot-outs, <br>
            <br>
            9) a single coin-toss (a Tournament Official will arbitrarily decide 
            which team predicts the toss outcome)<br>
            <br>
            In all four-team pools, when two teams are tied, that tie will be 
            broken by way of the first tie-breaking criterion (as shoot-out wins 
            are taken into consideration in this criterion). <br>
            <br>
            Should more than two teams be tied, this list will be used in sequence 
            (starting at criterion #1) for each pair of tied teams and followed 
            in order until the tie is broken and then the efforts at breaking 
            the tie between the other tied teams will commence with criterion 
            #1 again, until all ties are broken and the teams are assigned a ranking 
            or placing. <br>
            <br>
            In pools of three teams, the tie-breaking criteria will always start 
            with criterion #2 as these pools play only cross-over games and do 
            not play each other in the Ice Jam portion of the Icebreaker.<br>
            <br>
            <B> "Ice Floe" (Play-Off) Games</B><br>
            <br>
            Although, the pairings for the first round of "Ice Floe" games will 
            vary depending upon the size of the age category, in general, the 
            each team’s first game will be a "cross-over" game against a team 
            from the other pool in that age category. The First Place team in 
            Pool A will play the Fourth Place team in Pool B. The Second Place 
            team in Pool A will compete against the Third Place team in Pool B, 
            and so on. <br>
            <br>
            In instances where an age category has five (5) teams, there will 
            be a single Round-Robin and the First Place team in the Ice Jam portion 
            of the Tournament will play the Fourth Place team, and the Second 
            Place team will play against the Third Place team in the Semi-Finals. 
            The Fifth place team will be eliminated from the Tournament.<br>
            <br>
            In age categories where there are seven (7) competing teams, there 
            will be a single Round-Robin, from which the top four ranked teams 
            will play Semi-Finals (First vs. Fourth, and Second vs. Third). In 
            both the five (5) and seven (7) team divisions, there will be a Final 
            game between the winners of the two Semi-Final games. <br>
            <br>
            Again, there will be no ties. All games in the "Ice Floe" rounds that 
            are tied at the end of regulation time, will immediately proceed to 
            a five-player shoot-out (penalty kicks). If the teams are still tied 
            after each team has taken five penalty kicks, FIFA sudden-death penalty 
            kicks will be taken until a winner is declared. <br>
            <br>
            Although most age categories play an Ice Floe game on Saturday afternoon 
            and the rest on the Sunday of the Tournament, some age groups play 
            all of their Ice Floe games on Sunday. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Icebreaker "Melt Down" Game</b> <br>
            <br>
            The Divisional Championship game, which is called the "Melt Down" 
            will also be played on Sunday. Again, all ties at the end of regulation 
            time, will be settled via a five-player shoot-out. If the teams are 
            still tied after each team has taken five penalty kicks, FIFA sudden-death 
            penalty kicks will be taken until a winner is declared. <br>

            <b>ELIMINATION </b><br>
            <br>
           	A team must lose two* games in the "Ice Floe" rounds or the "Melt Down" final to be eliminated.  
	<br /><br />
	This feature is where the Tournament derives the "Dual" portion of its name.  
	<br /><br />
	(*The only exception to this rule is that the team that made it to the "Melt Down" undefeated may lose only the Final game and yet be considered to have been "eliminated" because no re-match will be played.)

            <b>HOME TEAM </b><br>
            <br>
            	The team listed first on the game schedule (i.e. in the left hand column of the schedule) will be considered to be the Home Team for that game and will be required to change its colour of shirt should a colour “clash” occur.
	<br /><br />
	Once the pairing of teams in any particular game is determined by the “schematic” as opposed to a pre-determined schedule of named teams, the team coming from the lower-numbered game, will be the Home Team for the game-in-question and will be required to change its colour of jersey should a “clash” occur with its opponents’ jersey colour .
	<br /><br />
	The Home Team will also be responsible for providing a Game Ball that is deemed of sufficient quality by the Referee.  Should the Home Team not be able to satisfy the Referee’s quality standard for the Game Ball, the “Visiting” Team will be asked to provide such a ball.  Should neither team be able to provide a ball of sufficient quality, the Referee will choose the best ball available from any source at that time.

            <b>UNFAVOURABLE WEATHER AND UNUSABLE FIELD CONDITIONS </b><br>
            <br>
            	Under normal conditions, every game is to be played at its scheduled time and location.  However, if inclement weather conditions or unusable field conditions occur, the location and kick-off time may be changed. However, unless previously advised otherwise by the Tournament Chairman, or his delegate, all scheduled teams must appear at the scheduled location at the stated start time regardless of these conditions.
	<br /><br />
	Referees have the authority to delay, stop or suspend any game due to weather and/or field conditions.  Field Convenors have the authority to delay the start of a game or to re-locate or re-schedule it due to weather and/or field conditions.
	<br /><br />
	No game will be played in an electrical storm.  When an electrical storm occurs during a game, play will be immediately suspended (delayed) until the storm passes.  Under no circumstances may teams withdraw from the playing field or venue area, (the parking lots etc.) until the Referee or his delegate has advised them that they may do so.  
	<br /><br />
	A)	If a game is abandoned (i.e. will not be completed) the Tournament Discipline Committee will rule on that game’s status, but every reasonable attempt must be made to complete all games in their entirety.  When 75% or more of a game has been played, and the Referee determines that play cannot safely continue due to weather and/or field and/or light conditions, that game will be abandoned (ended) and will be considered to have been completed and the score at that time will become the final regulation time score. 
	<br /><br />
	B)	If a game is suspended and then re-started, the game will not be deemed to have been completed simply because 75% of the game time has been played.  Instead, play must continue as long as is safely possible - regardless of any single or multiple weather-caused or field-conditions-caused game suspensions, unless that game is declared by the Referee to be “unfinishable” due to inclement weather or light-loss. In the event that a game is suspended due to field conditions, the remainder of the game may be played later that same day or the following morning (if appropriate) on another field.  The Tournament President, in consultation with the convenor of the affected age group and any other persons that they may choose, will make the final decision as to the possible re-scheduling and re-location of the remainder of the suspended game. 
	<br /><br />
	C)	If when a game is suspended it is less than 75% completed and it is later decided that it cannot be re-started, re-scheduled or re-located, the game will be declared as complete and the existing score will become the final regulation time score.  
	<br /><br />
	In situations described in A), B) and C) above, occur, and should the final regulation time score be tied, all efforts will be made to conduct the shoot-out portion of the competition.  If necessary, the shoot-out will be re-scheduled and/or re-located.  If a shoot-out is impossible to hold, a single coin toss will be used to determine the winner of the game.  A Tournament Official will arbitrarily decide which team predicts the toss outcome.

This check-in is simply to verify the team’s arrival and to ascertain that they are at the correct field as some venues have several fields.
	<br /><br />
	Teams that did not have their player cards or passbooks, their Official Icebreaker Tournament Roster and Game Sheets verified and stamped by Tournament Officials on Team Registration Verification Night, are required to check-in with the Field Marshall, or his or her delegate at the scheduled playing field, sixty (60) minutes before the kick-off of the team’s first game in order to have each player’s passbook or card verified as being current and for the correct age group.  At that time, these teams are also to present the Field Marshall with the Travel Permission Form and Proof of Insurance Coverage documentation (if these documents are required and had not previously been sent in by mail, fax or e-mail to the Tournament Organizing Committee).

            <B>LAWS OF THE GAME</B> <BR>
            <BR>
            All games will be played in accordance with the Laws of the Game as 
            published by FIFA, except as described below. <bR>
            <br>
            <B> SUBSTITUTIONS</B> <bR>
            <br>
            Teams in the U-10 and U-11 age groups can register, dress and play 
            as many as 15 players in the Tournament. All Premier and Division 
            1 teams may register, dress and play up to 18 players. A player may 
            be registered on only one team and the team may not use any player 
            whose name does not appear on the Official Tournament Roster (of which 
            the Field Marshal has a copy). <bR>
            <br>
            Substitutions, with the consent of the Referee, may be made at the 
            following times: <bR>
            <br>
            <b>- on any goal kick<bR>
            <br>
            - on a team’s own throw-in (however, if the throwing team chooses 
            to make a substitution, then the other team can make a substitution 
            as well) <bR>
            <br>
            - after a goal has been scored - at half time or at the start of any 
            other period of play - to replace an injured/bleeding player; and<bR>
            <br>
            - to replace a cautioned player</b> <bR>
            <br>
            A player who is <b><u>bleeding must</u></b> leave the field for treatment 
            and will not be allowed to resume playing until after the Referee 
            has verified that the area of the body (other than the inside of the 
            nose or mouth) from which the player was bleeding has been properly 
            covered and that the bleeding has stopped. In the case of a nose-bleed 
            or an internal mouth injury, it will be sufficient for the Referee 
            to ascertain that the bleeding has stopped in order for the player 
            to be allowed to re-enter the game. <br>
            <br>
            Substitutions will be unlimited in number - with the consent of the 
            Referee. <br>
            <br>
            Substitutions will <u>not</u> be permitted for a player who has been 
            ejected from that game. <bR>
            <br>
            <b>GAME REPORTS</b> <bR>
            <br>
            The Referee will <b>record goals scored during <u>both regulation 
            time and during a shoot-out</u> </b>and <b>note all cautions and ejections 
            on the Game Report <u>and complete the approved OSA forms for all cautions, 
            dismissals and Special Incidents</u></b>. The Referee will <b>verify the 
            correctness of the Game Report by signing it </b>at the end of the 
            match.<br>
            <br>
            Any player who is shown a Red Card will automatically be suspended 
            (as per the OSA’s discipline rules) from his or her team’s next game.<br>
            <br>
            A player who is shown a second Red Card will not be allowed to play 
            in any more games in this Tournament (as per the OSA’s discipline 
            rules) and cannot be substituted for on the Official Tournament Roster.<br>
            <br>
            A player who is shown a third or subsequent Yellow Card during this 
            Tournament, will automatically be suspended from the remainder of 
            the current game being played and will not be allowed to play in his 
            or her team's next game in this Tournament (as per the OSA’s discipline 
            rules). Should the third or additional Yellow Card be that player's 
            first card in the current game, that player will be suspended for 
            the rest of that game, but can be substituted. Should this Yellow 
            Card be his or her second card during the current game, the player 
            will be shown a Red Card and will be ejected and his or her team will 
            not be permitted to substitute for that player for the remainder of 
            the current game. That player will also be suspended from his or her 
            team's next game in this Tournament (as per the OSA’s discipline rules). 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the U-10 and U-11 age groups, the minimum number of players required 
            in order to commence or to continue a game is five (5). For all other 
            age groups, the minimum number of players required in order to commence 
            or to continue a game is seven (7). <br>
            <br>
            Should a team become unable to commence or to continue a game due 
            to the fact that a sufficient number of its players has received Red 
            or Yellow Cards, that team will be suspended from further participation 
            in the Tournament. The winning team will be awarded the win by a score 
            of 2-0 or by the existing score at the time of suspension of the game 
            if that is more favourable to the winning team. <br><br>Should a team be unable 
            to commence or to continue a game because it cannot "field" the minimum 
            required number of players due to injuries or other absences, that 
            team will be declared to have lost the current game by default (if 
            the game has not started) or by a score of 2-0 or by the existing 
            score at the time when the game was halted (whichever score is most 
            favourable to the team that is being awarded the win), but the losing 
            team will be allowed to continue in the Tournament (as long as this 
            is not the losing team’s second loss after the "Ice Jam" round of 
            games) if it can "field" the minimum required number of players in 
            its future scheduled or assigned games.<br>
            <br>
            <b>DURATION OF GAMES</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>All "Ice Jam" (Round-robin) games will be thirty (30) minutes 
            long</b>, and although there will be <b>no half-time break</b>, teams will change 
            ends at the half-point of the game.<br>
            <br>
            <b>All "Ice Floe" (Play-off) games and the "Melt Down" (Championship) 
            game in each Division will consist of twenty (20) minute halves</b>, and 
            there will be a five (5) minute break at half-time. <br>
            <br>
            <b>SHOOT-OUTS</b> <br>
            <br>
            All games whose scores are tied at the end of regulation time, will 
            immediately proceed to a shoot-out. FIFA shoot-out rules will apply 
            except that in the <b>"Ice Jam"</b> Round-Robin games, the number 
            of players participating in the shoot-out will be <b>three (3) per team</b>. 
            Should the score remain tied after these six players have shot, the 
            sudden death shoot-out rule will apply.<br>
            <br>
            <b>In all other games in this Tournament</b>, FIFA’s shoot-out rules will 
            apply including that allowing for the number of shooters for each 
            team to be <b>five (5)</b>. If the score remains tied after each of these 
            ten players has shot, the sudden-death shoot-out rule will apply. 
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <b><u>UNFAVOURABLE WEATHER AND UNUSABLE FIELD CONDITIONS</u></b> <br>
            <br>
            <b><u>No game will be played in an electrical storm.</u></b> <br><br>When 
            an electrical storm occurs during a game, <b>play will be immediately 
            suspended</b> until the storm passes. Under no circumstances may teams 
            withdraw from the playing field area, (the parking lots etc.) until 
            the Referee or his delegate has advised them that they may do so. 
            <b>This decision will be made in consultation with the Field Marshal 
            and/or the Tournament Chairman.</b> If a game is abandoned, the Tournament 
            Discipline Committee will rule on that game’s status, but every reasonable 
            attempt must be made to complete the game in its entirety. When 75% 
            or more of a game has been played, and play cannot continue, that 
            game will be suspended and will be considered to have been completed 
            and the score at the time of the suspension of the game will be the 
            final score.<br><br>
            <b><u>N.B. Please note that once a game has been started, the referee and 
            referee’s assistants will be paid in full, regardless of whether the 
            game is completed or not. </u></b><br>
            <br>Although, a Referee may rule 
            on the cancellation or abandonment of a single game, the decision 
            regarding the cancellation of the tournament (in whole or in part) 
            will be made <b>SOLELY by the Tournament Chairman.</b> <br><br> </font>
