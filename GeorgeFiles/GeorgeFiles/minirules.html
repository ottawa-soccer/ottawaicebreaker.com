<b>MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MINI AND "REGULATION PLAY"</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Introduction:</b><br />
The differences between FIFA's Laws (for "Regulation Play") and the ERSL Rules for Mini Soccer, relate to the number of players (maximum of 7 and minimum of 5), the size of the field, the size of the ball (FIFA Size #4), the size of the goals, the duration of play, the absence of goal areas, the forbidding of charging, and the elimination of Direct free kicks - except for Penalty Kicks.
<br /><br />
This portion of the Icebreaker Mini Soccer Rules repeats the ERSL Rules regarding Free Kicks (resulting from Fouls and Misconducts) and Corner Kicks; and summarizes the Rules respecting the scoring of goals from "set plays".
<br /><br />
<b>A - Fouls and Misconducts</b><br /><br />
1. A player who, in the opinion of the referee, intentionally commits any of the following offences shall be penalized by the awarding of an indirect free kick to the opposing team: <br />
<br />
a) Kicks or attempts to kick an opponent; <br />
b) Trips or attempts to trip an opponent; <br />
c) Jumps at an opponent; <br />
d) Charges an opponent in any manner; <br />
e) Strikes or attempts to strike, or spits at an opponent; <br />
f) Holds an opponent; <br />
g) Pushes an opponent; <br />
h) Spits at an opponent; <br />
i) Tackles an opponent to gain possession of the ball, making contact with the opponent before touching the ball; <br />
j) Deliberately handles the ball (except the goalkeeper within his/her own penalty area); <br />
(Should a player commit one of the above offences (a to j) within his/her own penalty area, while the ball is in play, irrespective of the position of the ball, a penalty kick shall be awarded to the opposing team.) 
k) Plays in a dangerous manner; <br />
l) Impedes the progress of an opponent; <br />
m) Prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his/her hands; <br />
n) If, when playing as a goalkeeper, and within his/her own penalty area, takes more than six (6) seconds while controlling the ball with his/her hands, before releasing it from his/her possession or, touches the ball again with his/her hands after it has been released from his/her possession and has not touched any other player or, touches the ball with his/her hands after it has been deliberately kicked to him/her by a team-mate or, touches the ball with his/her hands after he/she has received it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate or, wastes time; <br />
o) Commits any other offence, not previously mentioned in Law 12, for which play is stopped to caution or dismiss a player 
(Should a player commit one of the above offences (k to o) within his/her own penalty area, the kick shall be taken from that part of the penalty area line which runs parallel to the goal line, at the point nearest to where the offence was committed). 
<br /><br />

<b>B - Free Kicks</b><br /><br />
1. For any infringement of the Laws of the Game when the ball is in play, the referee may award a free kick to the team opposing that of the offending player. The free kick shall be taken from the place where the infringement occurred, unless the free kick is awarded to the attacking team within its opponents' penalty area. Please refer to Law 8. <br />
2. At the taking of a free kick, the ball shall be stationary and all opponents shall be not less than 6 metres from the ball until it has been kicked. The ball shall be in play when it is kicked and moved. <br />
3. A player taking a free kick within his/her own penalty area shall kick the ball into play beyond the penalty area. The ball shall be in play when it is kicked and moved and has passed outside the penalty area. All opponents shall be outside the penalty area and not less than 6 metres from the ball until it has been kicked. For any infringement of this Law, the free kick shall be retaken. <br />
4. A player taking a free kick shall not play or touch the ball a second time until it has been played or touched by another player. For any infringement of this Law, a free kick shall be awarded to the opposing team, to be taken in accordance with Section 1 of this Law. <br />
5. A player who does not retire the required distance, or who gesticulates or dances about in a manner calculated to distract an opponent shall be cautioned for unsporting conduct. <br />
6. A goal may not be scored directly from a free kick. <br />
<br /><br />

<b>C - Corner Kick</b><br /><br />
1. When the whole of the ball has crossed the goal line, either on the ground or in the air, excluding that portion between the goal posts, having last been played or touched by a member of the defending team, a corner kick shall be awarded to the attacking team. <br />
2. The corner kick shall be taken from within the corner arc nearest to where the ball crossed the goal line. All opponents shall be not less than 6 metres from the ball until it has been kicked. The ball must be kicked and moved to be in play. <br />
3. If the player taking the corner kick plays or touches the ball a second time before it has been played or touched by another player, a free kick shall be awarded to the opposing team, to be taken in accordance with Section 1 of Law 13. <br />
4. A goal may be scored directly from a corner kick. <br /><br />
