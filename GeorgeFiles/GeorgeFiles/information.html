					<font style="background-color:#FFFF66"> <b> NOTICE</b> </font><br />
				
				Again this year, the maximum number of U-12 and OLDER TEAMS that we have been authorized to accept into the Icebreaker has been set at 160 for the Girls' Icebreaker and 120 for the Boys' week-end.   
				 Please register your team as soon as you can (even before your final player selections have been made) so as to try to avoid disappointment because in each of the last four years, we have had to turn down approximately 50 teams' applications for entry in one or the other of the two week-end competitions.  <b> PLEASE NOTE:  WE DO NOT </b> need a players' list or Team Roster when you register.  We simply need to know that your team exists and in which League and Division you will play.  As per usual, we will close groups when they are full - even if this occurs before April 12, 2011.  Thanks.

				<b>THE I7th ANNUAL OTTAWA INTERNATIONALS'
				"ICEBREAKER" SOCCER TOURNAMENT </b>
				<br />
			</font>
				<br />
				<b>Girls: May 28 and 29, 2011 :~: Boys: June 4 and 5, 2011</b>
				<br />
				<br /></font></center>
			  <font color="#000033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dear Soccer Friends:</b>
				<br />
				<br />
				The Ottawa Internationals Soccer Club is once again very pleased to cordially invite your team to participate in the "Icebreaker" Soccer Tournament. 
				<br /><br />
				As usual, the Icebreaker will be split over two week-ends: with the Girls' Tournament being held on the week-end of May 28/29 and the Boys' Tournament being held the following week-end of June 4/5, 2011.  Both competitions will include two competitive categories (the "Ice" Pile and the "Snow" Bank) in all of the age groupings from U-10 to U-18 (both inclusive). As has been the case since 1997, the "Icebreaker" will again feature the exciting and action-packed "Dual Shoot-Out" format, which guarantees each team a minimum of six (6) games, settles all games whose scores are tied at the end of regulation time by way of a Shoot-Out, and eliminates a team from further competition only after it has lost two (2) play-off round games.
				<br />
				<br />
				All of the "Icebreaker's" games will be held in the City of Ottawa, and, subject to receiving the minimum number of entries, competitions in the following age categories will be held: <br /><br />
				<b>Age Group Birth Dates </b><br />
				__________________________________________________________ <br />
				Under-10 (Mini Soccer - 7-a-side) Born on or after January 1, 2001<br />
				Under-11 (Mini Soccer - 7-a-side) Born on or after January 1, 2000<br />
				Under-12 Born on or after January 1, 1999<br />
				Under-13 Born on or after January 1, 1998<br />
				Under-14 Born on or after January 1, 1997<br />
				Under-15 Born on or after January 1, 1996<br />
				Under-16 Born on or after January 1, 1995<br />
				Under-17 Born on or after January 1, 1994<br />
				Under-18 Born on or after January 1, 1993<br />
				<br />
				A minimum of six (6) and a maximum of twelve (12) teams will be eligible to compete in each Divisional Age Grouping.  As has become customary for the Icebreaker, if demand warrants it, Divisions may be expanded and/or more than one Divisional Section may be established.
				<br /><br />
				Register early in order to avoid disappointment. The maximum number of players per team is 15 for U-10 and U-11 teams and 18 for all older teams. A player may be registered on only one team and in only one age group. The Entry Fees are $400 for the U-10 and U-11 Divisions and $450 for all other age groups.
			  <br />
				<br />
				This Tournament is pending approval by the Ontario Soccer Association as an "ONACC" Tournament which means that only Competitive Club Teams from North America are eligible to participate. 
				<br /><br />
				All teams must supply proof that they are registered with their District, Provincial or State soccer association. In addition, all out-of-district teams must produce a Travel Permit from their home soccer association which authorizes that team to compete in the Icebreaker and that all players are registered to participate in this Tournament's class. Validly certified player passbooks or cards will be the only proof of player registration that will be accepted. Improperly registered or unregistered players or teams will not be permitted to participate. Teams must carry and supply proof of injury and liability insurance while participating in this event.  Your team's FULLY-AUTHORIZED or APPROVED Travel Permit includes and proves this insurance coverage. 
				<br /><br />
				For additional information, please visit our Club's web-site at "www.ottawaicebreaker.com".<br /><br />
				<b><center>The ENTRY DEADLINE is April 12, 2010</center></b>
				<br />
				
				
				<b>WHAT Is a "Dual Shoot-Out" Tournament?</b><br />
				
				A Dual Shoot-Out is a tournament whose structure differs from that of a standard round-robin or cross-over tournament in that:<br />
				a) ALL games that have a tied score at the end of regulation time, immediately proceed to a shoot-out in order to declare a winner, and<br />
				b) a team must lose two (2) games in the play-off rounds in order to be eliminated from further competition.
				<br /><br />
				This format provides all teams with a minimum of 6 fast-paced, exciting games, while allowing all teams to remain "in the hunt" for the Tournament Championship, even if that team has lost its first four games! 
				<br /><br />
				The purpose of this early-season tournament is to provide each team with an opportunity:<br />
				to play at least six (6) short games, so as to give each team a chance to see how they "stack up" against several opponents;
				to help to integrate or incorporate new players into their teams; and<br />
				to allow coaches an opportunity to experiment with new line-ups, strategies or tactics or to move players into different positions, 
				without the pressure of having to win each game in order to advance in the Tournament.
				<br /><br />
				This format was introduced to Ottawa in the 1997 edition of the "Icebreaker" and has been so favourably received and complimented by the vast majority of teams that have participated in the Icebreaker during the last fourteen years, that it has become an "unofficial Ottawa tradition" to start the outdoor soccer season with the Icebreaker's "Dual Shoot-Out" format .
				<br /><br />
				In order to play in the following Age Categories, the player must be born on or after the following dates:
				<br /><br />
				
				<b>Age Group Birth Dates </b><br />
				___________________________________<br />
				
				Under-10 Born on or after January 1, 2001<br />
				Under-11 Born on or after January 1, 2000 <br />
				Under-12 Born on or after January 1, 1999 <br />
				Under-13 Born on or after January 1, 1998 <br />
				Under-14 Born on or after January 1, 1997 <br />
				Under-15 Born on or after January 1, 1996 <br />
				Under-16 Born on or after January 1, 1995<br />
				Under-17 Born on or after January 1, 1994<br />
